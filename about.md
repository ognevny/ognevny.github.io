# About me

I'm Maksim, living at Moscow, studying in MAI, employeed

## What I do?

On GitHub my main work is done at [MSYS2](https://github.com/msys2) organization. Currently I'm a colaborator in MINGW-packages, MSYS2-packages and msys2.github.io repositories. Sometimes I contribute to open-source projects, mostly to make them compile/work in MSYS2 environment.

The other thing is abstracts from MAI classes. I started creating them in Markdown + hand-written (with xournalpp) notes, but now I've switched to Typst, which make my materials easy to compile into PDF files.
